Webscraping Crypto Calculator

Description / Purpose - the purpose of this project is for you to pick a cryptocurrency from the list printed and then enter the
amount you have and calculates the total worth of you cryptocurrency. 

Dependencies - I created this in eclipse and you need to add the jsoup library into yopur referenced libraries.

Usage - This can be used at any time to calculate the current value of your tokens/coins with the most recent prices.

Future Work - I was originally planning to make a GUI interface but I was unnable to get it to work in time to turn it in but
I can see myself making that update for my personal use to potentially calculate multiple values at once.

I am an Information Systems major and this relates to my major because the I learned how to code in java throughout my college career
at Coastal.
